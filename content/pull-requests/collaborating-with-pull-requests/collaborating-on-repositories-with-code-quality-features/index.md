# Import any necessary libraries or modules

# Define any necessary variables or functions

# Read in the code you want to test

# Define any necessary test cases

# Use a loop to iterate through each test case and run the code

# Use conditional statements to check if the output is correct or if there are any errors

# If an error is found, print a message indicating the type of error and the line number where it occurred

# Repeat the loop until all test cases have been completed

# Print a message indicating the total number of errors found and any recommendations for fixing them

# Save the output to a file or display it on the screen
